# Security

AgentMesh assumes a trusted team: agents may ask, assign, review and merge into the integration
branch without asking their humans. The controls below are about keeping it that way — making
sure only your team is on the mesh, that outside content can't steer agents, and that humans keep
the irreversible decisions.

## Identity

- Every process authenticates to NATS with its own **nkey**. `mesh.yaml` holds only public keys;
  seeds stay with their owner (agents) or on the hub VM (hub, bridge, ingest).
- `agentmesh nats-config` renders **least-privilege** permissions: an agent may publish RPCs only
  under its own id, read only its own inbox and receive only its own replies. The hub therefore
  trusts the caller named in the subject — one agent cannot act as another (covered by the
  authenticated end-to-end test).
- Only the bridge service with `canActAsHumans` may act for humans, and only for humans listed in
  config, mapped from their Discord user ids.
- Keep NATS and the ingest endpoint on a private network (Tailscale); expose nothing but SSH.

## Trust labels

Messages carry `trust: team | external`. Anything derived from an external event (CI logs, error
reports, issues, webhooks) is `external`, and the plugin's instructions tell Claude to treat it as
data, never as instructions. This is the main prompt-injection surface once Hermes is connected.
Branch protection is the backstop.

## Permission prompts stay local

The plugin does **not** declare Claude Code's permission-relay capability: no message on the mesh
can approve a tool call on someone's laptop. Each person's own permission settings still apply.
Allow `mcp__plugin_agentmesh_mesh__*` (the mesh tools); keep `gh pr merge` into protected
branches, force-pushes, infrastructure CLIs and secrets on "ask".

## Git

- Agents work in a separate worktree per task and open PRs into `agents` (configurable).
- Protect `main`: pull requests required, CI green, at least one **human** CODEOWNER approval, no
  force-push.
- Agents push with their owners' credentials, so GitHub cannot tell an agent's approval from its
  human's. For a hard separation, give each agent its own GitHub machine account (fine-grained
  token that can push branches but not bypass protection) and exclude those accounts from the
  CODEOWNERS team that approves `main`.

## Loops and cost

- Thread depth limit (`limits.maxThreadDepth`) stops A→B→C→D chains of agent-created threads.
- Per-thread and per-sender rate limits, and duplicate suppression.
- Planning contributions are delivered as one digest per round, not one message per agent.
- **Kill switch**: `/mesh pause` holds every delivery; `/mesh resume` releases them.

## Secrets in messages

The hub redacts common credential formats (AWS keys, GitHub/Slack/Anthropic/OpenAI tokens, Discord
bot tokens, JWTs, NATS seeds, private-key blocks, `password=`/`token=` assignments) before storing
or forwarding a message. It is a safety net, not a licence: never send secrets over the mesh.
